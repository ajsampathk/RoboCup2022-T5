# RoboCup2022-T5
RoboCup Simulation project for the Robotics TDP course 2022.
MatLab simulation Environment 

## Stage 1:

In the first stage we are hoping to create a simulation environment in Matlab of one NAO6 based robot inside an empty world environment. 

Trying to model all the joint mechanisms required for high-level control, for eg: walk/run to position, kick, etc. , the advantages and disadvantages of both 3D and 2D visualization 
will be noted. 

Once the robot can be controlled by simple numeric commands (through a variable block), the end result we will try to achieve is to interface the simulation with ROS through  
[the ROS toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/ros/ug/get-started-with-ros.html)
